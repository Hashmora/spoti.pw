// Sing's engine: the vocals of what Spotify plays separated ahead of it, and turned down as it plays.
//
// The model takes two seconds at a time and is far too slow for the render thread, so the engine stands
// between Spotify's mixer and its output and pulls the mixer ahead of what plays: up to twice what a
// render asks for, until the sound it holds (the lead) is a window plus the model's time, and never past sound Spotify
// has not decoded yet (a part its mixer marks silent is left out, and read again at the next render). A worker thread
// takes the held sound two seconds at a time, every 1.5 s, runs the separator and writes the vocals into a
// second ring beside it, the half second the windows share crossfaded. Each render plays the held sound
// from the oldest frame on, the vocals turned down by the level once a hop of them is in ahead, and dry once fewer
// than the reserve are (as the lead fills, or when the model falls behind), with a budget for falling behind. Not
// separating (switched off, held, given up, without a model), it plays the lead it holds on as it is, dry, and lets it
// go only with a flush, where nothing heard is lost; once off and let go, it is a straight pull again.
//
// Spatial voice: the vocals' middle (left plus right, halved) can be put at an angle off straight ahead,
// where Sing.x holds it as the head turns. The ear facing it hears it louder and the other quieter at the same
// power (an equal-power pan, narrowed so that the far ear never loses it), and the far ear hears it up to
// 0.65 ms later (the time sound takes around a head) and duller, through a one-pole low-pass for the head's
// shadow. The vocals' sides (left less right, halved) stay where they are, so straight ahead plays the vocals
// exactly as separated.
//
// What plays is the lead behind what Spotify's decoder has handed over, which is what Spotify's clock
// counts when the player reports. Its clock then runs on by the time alone, so a position reported at a moment
// (Sing.x: when that line of the clock began) has the lead held at that moment taken off, less what was dropped since (SGSingEngineLeadAt): a lead filling
// after a report does not move what is heard, and one let go moves it on. Sing.x asks for a flush when Spotify
// seeks or skips, which drops the sound held from before it.
//
// Threading: SGSingEngineRender on the render thread only, allocation and lock free; the worker is the
// engine's own; everything else from any thread.
